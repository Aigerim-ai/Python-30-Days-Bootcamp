### 🐍 **Exercise: Favorite Books Organizer**

#### 🎯 **Goal:**

Practice creating, modifying, and converting between lists and tuples in Python.

---

### 📌 Instructions:

1. **Create a list** named `favorite_books` that contains the titles of **5 books** (as strings).

2. **Print** the first and last book in the list using indexing.

3. **Add** a new book to the list using `append()`.

4. **Insert** a book at the second position in the list using `insert()`.

5. **Remove** one book from the list using `remove()` or `pop()`.

6. **Sort** the list in alphabetical order.

7. **Convert** the list `favorite_books` into a **tuple** called `books_tuple`.

8. **Try to change** one element in `books_tuple` (and write a comment on what happens and why).

9. **Loop** through `books_tuple` and print each book title.

### ✅ Bonus Challenge:

- Count how many books in the tuple contain the word `"the"` (case-insensitive).
- Slice the tuple to get the **middle 3 books** (if available).
