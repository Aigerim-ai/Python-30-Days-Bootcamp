### **Python Basics â€“ Student Exercise**

This exercise is designed to help you practice key Python concepts, including **Introduction, Variables, Keywords, Data Types, Expressions, Strings, Numbers, Operators, and User Input.**

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Part 1: Introduction to Python**

### **Q1: What is Python?**

- Write a short paragraph describing what Python is and why it is popular.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Part 2: Working with Variables**

### **Q2: Variable Assignment**

Write a Python script that:

1. Creates a variable named `city` and stores your favorite cityâ€™s name in it.
2. Creates another variable named `year` and stores the current year.
3. Print the sentence:

```
I live in <city> and the current year is <year>.
```

**Example Output:**

```
I live in New York and the current year is 2025.
```

## **ðŸ“Œ Part 3: Understanding Keywords and Identifiers**

### **Q3: Identifying Valid Variable Names**

Which of the following are valid variable names in Python? (Explain why or why not for each)

- `first_name`
- `2ndName`
- `total$amount`
- `True`
- `my_var`

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Part 4: Data Types in Python**

### **Q4: Understanding Data Types**

For each of the following variables, identify the data type:

```python
a = 100          # Integer
b = "Python"     # String
c = 3.14         # Float
d = True         # Boolean
```

Write a Python script to print the type of each variable using `type()`.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Part 5: Working with Expressions and Strings**

### **Q5: String Concatenation**

Write a Python script that:

1. Asks the user for their **first name** and **last name**.
2. Concatenates these two names into a full name.
3. Prints the full name as `"Hello, <Full Name>!"`.

**Example Output:**

```
Enter first name: John
Enter last name: Doe
Hello, John Doe!
```

---

### **Q6: String Operations**

What will be the output of this code?

```python
text = "Hello" + " World"
print(text)
```

Explain why the output is as it is.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Part 6: Numbers and Operators**

### **Q7: Arithmetic Operations**

Predict the output of the following expressions **before running the code**:

1. `7 + 3 * 2`
2. `(7 + 3) * 2`
3. `10 / 3`
4. `10 // 3`
5. `2 ** 3`

Then, run the expressions and check if your predictions are correct.

---

### **Q8: User Input and Arithmetic**

Write a Python script that:

1. Asks the user to input **two numbers**.
2. Performs **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**.
3. Prints the result of each operation.

**Example Output:**

```
Enter first number: 8
Enter second number: 4
Addition: 12
Subtraction: 4
Multiplication: 32
Division: 2.0
```

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Part 7: Logical and Comparison Operators**

### **Q9: Even or Odd Checker**

Write a Python program that:

1. Asks the user for a **number**.
2. Checks if the number is **even** or **odd** using the modulus operator (`%`).
3. Prints `"Even number"` if it is even, otherwise prints `"Odd number"`.

**Example Output:**

```
Enter a number: 6
Even number
```

---

### **Q10: Greater Than Check**

Write a Python script that:

1. Asks the user to input **two numbers**.
2. Compares them using the greater than (`>`) operator and prints `"First number is greater"` or `"Second number is greater"` accordingly.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Submission Guidelines**

- Make sure to test your code thoroughly before submitting.
- Add comments where necessary to explain your code.
- Save the script as a `.py` file and submit it.

---

**Good luck and happy coding!**
