### Challenge: Conditional Statements in Python

#### Problem 1: Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero

Write a Python program that takes an integer as input and prints whether the number is:

- "Positive" if the number is greater than 0.
- "Negative" if the number is less than 0.
- "Zero" if the number is exactly 0.

#### Problem 2: Grade Determination

Write a Python program that takes a student's score (between 0 and 100) as input and prints the corresponding grade based on the following scale:

- "A" for scores greater than or equal to 90.
- "B" for scores between 80 and 89.
- "C" for scores between 70 and 79.
- "D" for scores between 60 and 69.
- "F" for scores below 60.

#### Problem 3: Even or Odd

Write a Python program that checks if a number is even or odd. If the number is divisible by 2, print "Even". Otherwise, print "Odd".

#### Problem 4: Leap Year Check

Write a Python program that takes a year as input and checks if it is a leap year. The program should print:

- "Leap Year" if the year is a leap year.
- "Not a Leap Year" if the year is not a leap year.

A year is a leap year if:

- It is divisible by 4.
- However, if it is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400.

#### Problem 5: Grading System with Edge Cases

Modify the grade determination program from Problem 2 to handle edge cases properly. Specifically, ensure that:

- If the input score is less than 0 or greater than 100, print "Invalid score".
- If the score is exactly 100, print "Grade: A" as well.

### Bonus Challenge: Nested Conditions

Write a Python program that takes a number and prints the following:

- If the number is divisible by both 2 and 3, print "Divisible by 2 and 3".
- If the number is divisible by 2 but not by 3, print "Divisible by 2 but not 3".
- If the number is divisible by 3 but not by 2, print "Divisible by 3 but not 2".
- Otherwise, print "Not divisible by 2 or 3".
