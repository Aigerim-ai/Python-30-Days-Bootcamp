### **Exercise: Python Expressions and Strings**

#### **Part 1: Arithmetic Expressions**

1. Write a Python program that calculates and prints the result of the following expression:  
   \[
   (8 + 2) \times 3 - 4 / 2
   \]
2. Given the variables:
   ```python
   a = 15
   b = 4
   ```
   - Calculate and print the result of integer division (`//`).
   - Calculate and print the remainder using the modulo operator (`%`).

#### **Part 2: Operator Precedence**

3. What will be the output of the following expression?
   ```python
   result = 5 + 3 * 2 ** 2
   print(result)
   ```
   - Predict the result before running the code.

#### **Part 3: String Operations**

4. Write a Python script that does the following:

   - Stores `"Python"` in a variable `x`.
   - Stores `"Programming"` in a variable `y`.
   - Concatenates `x` and `y` with a space in between and prints the result.

5. Write a program that takes a string input from the user and prints it three times using the `*` operator.

#### **Part 4: Escape Characters and Multi-line Strings**

6. Print the following text using **escape sequences**:

   ```
   "Python is fun!"
   Let's learn Python.
   Path: C:\Users\Python
   ```

7. Use a **multi-line string** to print the following:
   ```
   Python supports:
   - Strings
   - Numbers
   - Boolean values
   - Data Structures
   ```

#### **Bonus Challenge**

8. Write a Python script that asks the user for their name and prints a greeting in the format:
   ```
   Hello, [Name]! Welcome to Python programming.
   ```
   _(Hint: Use `input()` to take user input.)_

#### **Submission**

- Write and test your solutions in a Python script (`exercise.py`).
- Submit your answers along with a screenshot of your outputs.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
