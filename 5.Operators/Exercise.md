### **Exercise: Python Operators Practice**

#### **Instructions:**

Write a Python script to solve the following problems using appropriate operators.

1. **Arithmetic Operations:**

   - Given `x = 15` and `y = 4`, perform and print the result of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division, modulus, and exponentiation.

2. **Assignment Operators:**

   - Initialize `a = 10`, then perform the following operations and print the result after each step:
     - Add `5` to `a`
     - Multiply `a` by `3`
     - Subtract `8` from `a`
     - Divide `a` by `2` using floor division

3. **Comparison Operators:**

   - Given `m = 25` and `n = 30`, check the following conditions and print the result (`True` or `False`):
     - Is `m` equal to `n`?
     - Is `m` not equal to `n`?
     - Is `m` greater than `n`?
     - Is `m` less than or equal to `n`?

4. **Logical Operators:**

   - Given `p = True` and `q = False`, print the result of:
     - `p and q`
     - `p or q`
     - `not p`

5. **Identity Operators:**

   - Create two lists: `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = [1, 2, 3]`.
   - Assign `list3 = list1`.
   - Check and print the result of the following:
     - `list1 is list2`
     - `list1 is list3`
     - `list1 == list2`

6. **Membership Operators:**

   - Given `text = "Hello, Python!"`, check and print whether:
     - `"Python"` is in `text`
     - `"Java"` is not in `text`

7. **Bitwise Operators:**
   - Given `a = 5` (`101` in binary) and `b = 3` (`011` in binary), compute and print:
     - `a & b`
     - `a | b`
     - `a ^ b`
     - `~a`
     - `a << 1`
     - `b >> 1`
